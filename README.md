# bacwn

An implementation of Datalog for Clojure, based on the abandoned contrib-datalog.  This is not meant as a replacement for the contrib-datalog but instead as an extension to target both Clojure and ClojureScript.

![bacwn](https://raw.github.com/fogus/bacwn/master/doc/bacwn-logo.png "bacwn is delicious")

The Bacwn Datalog library is based on the old Clojure-contrib datalog implementation.  The library's syntax will change over time and it will be made to conform to modern Clojure's, but the spirit of the original will remain in tact.

*for a drop-in replacement for the contrib-datalog library see [Martin Trojer's contrib-datalog effort](https://github.com/martintrojer/datalog)*

## Usage

Caveat emptor. Bacwn is a work in progress and should be considered alpha software.  The ClojureScript port does not currently work - patches welcomed.
